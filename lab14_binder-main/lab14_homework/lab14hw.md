## Instructions
Answer the following questions in RMarkdown. Please embed all of your code and push your final work to your repository. Be sure to add your name to the author header above.



## Questions

1. Look up 'Data Scientist' at https://www.bls.gov/. What degree is required for this career? Is it a growing occupation?  

Bachelor's degree. Job Outlook between 2021-31 is 36%. This means it's a fast growing occupation.

2. How would you describe your data science skills on a resume for a job application? Write a blurb that reflects the skills you have learned in this course. 

Proficiency in creating visually appealing plots based on given data, using R programming to build interactive applications, tidying up, reorganizing, and sorting datasets to enhance readability, and extracting necessary information from datasets.


3. What are your current career interests, and how could your R skills support that career path? (hint: this might be good content for your LinkedIn profile ;)

As I strive towards my career goal in the veterinary or biological science field, I recognize the importance of possessing the skill of organizing datasets. This will aid me in my learning and also prove valuable in any future lab work.

4. What about this course has been the most difficult for you? What has been the most rewarding?

When it comes to this course, I've found that lengthy code can be a challenge as it requires careful inspection in order to pinpoint any issues. However, it's incredibly rewarding when the code does work as intended and produces aesthetic plots and applications.

5. What do you wish you had known, or what skills do you wish you had, before taking this class.

I wish I had more coding experience prior to taking this class as it would have helped me complete homework assignments more efficiently.

6. If we had 1 more lab in this class, what would you have liked to learn more about?

I would have liked to learn more about building more advanced applications 

7. Now that you have (almost!) completed this course, do you plan to persue further data or computer science skills? What do you plan to do?

I'd like to take more data or computer science classes to persue further skills.

8. How important was working with a partner to your success in this class? If this class were transitioned to an online format, how do you think that would affect your understanding?

Working with partners was incredibly helpful for me to succeed in this class. It's easier to understand course content when we're about to exchange knowledge and understanding with each other. I think it will be harder for me to find partners if this class transitioned to an online format, which require me to spend more time to understand coding.

9. Did you complete the class evaluation? Please complete the class evaluation using the link provided in the announcements. Your feedback is very important and we appreciate your time.

Yes, I did!
