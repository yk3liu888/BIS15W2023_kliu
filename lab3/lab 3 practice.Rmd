## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### 1. Plant Height Vector.
```{r}
plant_height <- c(30.7, 37.6, 28.4, NA, 33.2)
```

### 2. Plant Weight Vector.
```{r}
plant_weight <- c(4, 5.2, 3.7, NA, 4.6)
```

### 3. Labels for data matrix.
```{r}
samples <- c("plant1", "plant2", "plant3", "plant4", "plant5")
measured <- c("height", "weight")
```

### 4. Combine data for height and weight.
```{r}
plant_experiment <- c(plant_height, plant_weight)
```

### 5. Build the data matrix.
```{r}
plant_experiment_matrix <- matrix(plant_experiment, nrow = 5, byrow = F)
```

### 6. Name the columns and rows.
```{r}
colnames(plant_experiment_matrix) <- measured
rownames(plant_experiment_matrix) <- samples
```

### 7. Calculate the means of each column.
```{r}
plant_means <- colMeans(plant_experiment_matrix, na.rm=T)
plant_means
```

### 8. Add this as a new row.
```{r}
plant_experiment_matrix_final <- rbind(plant_experiment_matrix, plant_means)
```

### 9. Print the matrix.
```{r}
plant_experiment_matrix_final
```
